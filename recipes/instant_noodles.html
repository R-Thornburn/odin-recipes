            Instant noodles are a tasty and fast meal. Despite lacking in nutirtion or staying power, I keep coming back for more of that wonderful taste
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One package instant noodles (any variety will work)</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil</li>
            <li>Take package of noodles, and without breaking the seal, firmly pound it</li>
            <li>The aim here is to break the noodles into managable peices and to speed up the cooking process</li>
            <li>Pour broken noodles into serving bowl</li>
            <li>Some instant noodle packages include a small pouch of seasoning. At this time, remove the pouch, open it, and empty the contents into the serving dish</li>
            <li>Add hot water and wait until noodles are soft, stirring occasionally</li>
        </ol>
